Setup instructions:
1) Run `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment
2) run `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the environment
3) run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get python packages
Note: .gitignore will not push the venv and __pycache__ folders to keep the repo clean and of a manageable size
